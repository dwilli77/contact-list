# Contact List

This is a contact list used by my daughter's kindergarten class.

It can be viewed by [clicking here!](https://www.burleson-contact-list.herokuapp.com)

**Concerns**

- make a centralized contact list where parents can access the most up-to-date information at any time without the constant back-and-forth emails
- secure this information so it's not openly available to the public
- ensure the accuracy of the information provided

**Technology Used**

- Ruby on Rails
  - used to store, query, and display family contacts
- Devise
  - user authentication
  - protected create/edit views to be managed by admin
- Sass styling
